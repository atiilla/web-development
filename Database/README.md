## What is Database?
A database is an organized collection of data. It is the collection of schemas, tables, queries, reports, views, and other objects. A database management system (DBMS) is a collection of programs that enables you to store, modify, and extract information from a database. The DBMS provides many useful functions that do not come standard with the database. For example, the DBMS makes it possible to search for specific data in the database, update data in the database, and print out reports based on the data in the database.

## What we can do with Database?
* Store data
* Retrieve data
* Update data
* Delete data
  
## MongoDB vs MySQL
* MongoDB is a NoSQL database, MySQL is a relational database.
* MongoDB is a document database, MySQL is a table database.
* MongoDB is a schemaless database, MySQL is a schema-based database.
* MongoDB is a distributed database, MySQL is a centralized database.
* MongoDB is a JSON database, MySQL is a SQL database.
* MongoDB is a document-oriented database, MySQL is a table-oriented database.
* MongoDB is a non-relational database, MySQL is a relational database.
* MongoDB is a horizontal scaling database, MySQL is a vertical scaling database.
* MongoDB is a free and open-source database, MySQL is a proprietary database.
* MongoDB is a cross-platform database, MySQL is a platform-specific database.

## Why MongoDB?
* MongoDB is a document database, which means it stores data in JSON-like documents. MongoDB is a NoSQL database, which means it stores data in a way that is different from relational databases. MongoDB is a schemaless database, which means that documents in a collection do not need to have the same structure or fields. MongoDB is a distributed database, which means that data is stored across multiple machines. MongoDB is a JSON database, which means that documents in a collection are stored as JSON-like objects. MongoDB is a document-oriented database, which means that documents in a collection are grouped together. MongoDB is a non-relational database, which means that it does not use tables and rows like relational databases. MongoDB is a horizontal scaling database, which means that it scales by adding more machines into the cluster. MongoDB is a free and open-source database, which means that it is free to download and use. MongoDB is a cross-platform database, which means that it can run on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## MongoDB methods
* find() - returns all documents in a collection
* findOne() - returns the first document in a collection
* findByName() - returns the document with the specified name
* findById() - returns the document with the specified id
* insertOne() - inserts a document into a collection
* insertMany() - inserts multiple documents into a collection
* updateOne() - updates a document in a collection
* updateMany() - updates multiple documents in a collection
* deleteOne() - deletes a document from a collection
* deleteMany() - deletes multiple documents from a collection
* drop() - deletes a collection
* dropDatabase() - deletes the current database
* createCollection() - creates a collection
* createIndex() - creates an index on a collection
* createView() - creates a view on a collection
* createRole() - creates a role
* createUser() - creates a user
* createFunction() - creates a function
* createTrigger() - creates a trigger
* createServer() - creates a server
* createDatabase() - creates a database
* createSession() - creates a session
* createCollection() - creates a collection
* createIndex() - creates an index on a collection
* createView() - creates a view on a collection
