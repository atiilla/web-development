/* Exercise 3 functions */

// 1. Create a function called "add" that takes two arguments (parameters named "first" and "second") and returns their sum.


// 2. Create a function called "subtract" that takes two arguments (parameters named "first" and "second") and returns their difference.


// 3. Create a function called "multiply" that takes two arguments and returns their product.


// 4. Create a function called "divide" that takes two arguments and returns their quotient.


// 5. Create a function called "calculate" that takes three arguments. Assume the two arguments are a number ie num1, num2 and a function called operates (a callback).


// 6. Call the calculate function 4 times, each time using one of the operation functions you wrote


// 7. Create a function called "printDay" that takes one argument (a number from 1-7) and returns the day of the week (1 is Sunday, 2 is Monday etc.)
