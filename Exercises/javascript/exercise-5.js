/* Exercise math and date object */

// 1. Create a variable called "date" that stores the current date.

// 2. Create a variable called "today" that stores the day of the week as a number (1-7).

// 3. Create a variable called "calendar" that stores a string that is the date, a dash, the day of the week, a dash, and the month concatenated together. For example, "2018-4-18".

// 4. Console log the variables you created in steps 1, 2, and 3.

// 5. Create a function called "getDayName" that takes the day as a number and returns the day name as a string.


// Math object

// 6. Create a function called "getRandomInt" that takes a max and min number and returns a random number between the max and min. For example, getRandomInt(50, 100) should return a random number between 50 and 100.

// 7. Create a function called "getRandomIntBetweenDays" that takes two day numbers and returns a random day between the two days. For example, getRandomIntBetweenDays(1, 3) should return a random number between 1 and 3.

// 8. Create a function called "getRandomDate" that takes two dates and returns a random date between the two dates. For example, getRandomDate(new Date(2012, 0, 1), new Date()) should return a random date between Jan 1, 2012 and today.

// 9. Create a function called "getRandomDateBetweenDays" that takes two day numbers and returns a random date between the two days. For example, getRandomDateBetweenDays(1, 3) should return a random date between Sunday and Tuesday.
