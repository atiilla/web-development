/* Exercise for Fetch and Async programming */

var baseUrl ="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1";

// 1. Create a function called "fetchData" that takes one argument (the url to fetch) and returns a promise that resolves to the JSON object.

// 2. Call the function you created in step 1 with the baseUrl variable above and then console log the results.

// 3. Add a method to your promise that runs if the promise resolves successfully and passes the resolved value to a callback function.

// 4. Add a method to your promise that runs if the promise fails and passes the error to a callback function.

// 5. In one of your callbacks pass the resolved value to a function that iterates through the value and console logs the name of each property and its value.

// 6. In the other callback pass the error to a function that console logs the value of the error.
