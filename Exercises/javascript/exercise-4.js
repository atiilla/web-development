// find max points and print student name
// 4. Create a for loop that iterates through the students array and finds the student with the highest amount of points. Console log the value of their name.


// 5. define a function called "print" that takes a parameter called "student". The function should console log the value of the student's name, track, achievements and points.

// 6. call the print function and pass it the student object you created in step 5.

// 7. define a function called "getStudentReport" that takes a parameter called "student". The function should return a String that looks like the following: "Jill - PHP Development - 203 achievements - 19072 points"
