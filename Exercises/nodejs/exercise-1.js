/* Exercise basics */

// 1. Create a module that exports a function (or object) that takes a number as a parameter and stores it in a list. The list should not be accessible from outside the module.

// 2. Export another function that returns a version of the data list that is sorted in ascending order. The function you use to sort the data correctly should not be accessible from outside the module. (Think back to the Custom Sorting Exercise when handling sorting)

// 3. use process.argv, create a console application that takes a number as a parameter and adds it to the data list using the first module you created.

// 4. Add the numbers from the data list and output the result to the console.
